# Project Setup Notes

- **Create a repository**  
  ‚Üí Use `git init` to initialize a Git repo

- **Initialize the repository**  
  ‚Üí Run `npm init -y` to create `package.json`

- **node_modules, package.json, package-lock.json**  
  ‚Üí `node_modules`: installed packages  
  ‚Üí `package.json`: lists dependencies & scripts  
  ‚Üí `package-lock.json`: locks exact versions

- **Install express**  
  ‚Üí `npm install express`

- **Create a server**  
  ‚Üí

  ```js
  const express = require("express");
  const app = express();
  ```

- **Listen to port 7777**  
  ‚Üí

  ```js
  app.listen(7777, () => console.log("Server running"));
  ```

- **Write request handlers for /test , /hello**  
  ‚Üí

  ```js
  app.get("/test", (req, res) => res.send("Test route"));
  app.get("/hello", (req, res) => res.send("Hello route"));
  ```

- **Install nodemon and update scripts inside package.json**  
  ‚Üí `npm install --save-dev nodemon`  
  ‚Üí Inside `package.json`:

  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node src/app.js",
    "dev": "nodemon src/app.js"
  }
  ```

- **What are dependencies**  
  ‚Üí Packages your app needs to run (like express)

- **What is the use of "-g" while npm install**  
  ‚Üí Installs a package **globally** (usable from any folder)

- **Difference between caret and tilde ( ^ vs ~ )**  
  ‚Üí `^`: Updates to latest **minor** version (e.g. `^1.2.3` ‚Üí `1.x.x`)  
  ‚Üí `~`: Updates to latest **patch** version (e.g. `~1.2.3` ‚Üí `1.2.x`)

# üìö Multiple Route Handlers in Express.js

## ‚ùì Question: What is `next()` in Express?

### ‚úÖ Answer:

`next()` is a function in Express used to pass control to the next middleware function. If it‚Äôs not called, the next handler in the chain will not run.

---

## ‚ùì Question: How does `res.send()` affect `next()`?

### ‚úÖ Answer:

Once `res.send()` is called, the response is considered finished. Calling `next()` after `res.send()` can cause an error because the response is already sent.

Example:

```js
res.send("Hello"); // Ends the response
next();            // ‚ùå Error if called after res.send




‚ùì Question: How do multiple route handlers work?
‚úÖ Answer:
You can use multiple functions for a single route. Each middleware/handler is executed in order, and must call next() to continue to the next one.

Example:

js
Copy
Edit
app.get('/example', handler1, handler2);
‚ùì Question: What is the use of arrays in route handlers?
‚úÖ Answer:
You can group handlers in an array, and they will be executed in order. Useful for modular middleware.

Example:

js
Copy
Edit
app.use("/route", rH1, [rH2, rH3], rH4, rH5);
Execution order: rH1 ‚Üí rH2 ‚Üí rH3 ‚Üí rH4 ‚Üí rH5 (if each calls next())

‚ùì Question: What happens if one handler does not call next()?
‚úÖ Answer:
The chain stops there. No further handlers are executed.

```

# üìò Express.js Concepts and Middleware

## ‚ùì What is a Middleware? Why do we need it?

### ‚úÖ Answer:

A middleware in Express is a function that has access to the request, response, and `next()` function. It runs between the request and the final response.

We need middleware to:

- Modify request/response objects
- Execute code before route handlers
- Handle errors
- Manage authentication, logging, validation, etc.

---

## ‚ùì How does Express.js handle requests behind the scenes?

### ‚úÖ Answer:

Express uses a stack-like structure of middleware and route handlers. When a request comes in:

1. It goes through `app.use()` and route middlewares in the order they are defined.
2. If a matching route is found, its handler is called.
3. If `next()` is called, the request moves to the next matching middleware or route.
4. If none match, a 404 handler is called.

---

## ‚ùì Difference between `app.use()` and `app.all()`

### ‚úÖ Answer:

- `app.use(path, middleware)` handles **all HTTP methods** but **does not check for exact HTTP methods**. It‚Äôs commonly used for middleware.
- `app.all(path, handler)` matches **all HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.)** for the given route. It's used for universal route handling.

Example:

```js
app.use('/admin', authMiddleware); // All methods, acts like a filter
app.all('/maintenance', handler);  // GET, POST, PUT, DELETE etc.


‚ùó Error Handling Middleware in Express
Use a special middleware function with 4 arguments (err, req, res, next):

js
Copy
Edit
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).send('Something broke!');
});

# ‚úÖ User Schema ‚Äî Questions & Answers

---

## üìå 1. Explore `SchemaType` Options from the Documentation

**Answer:**  
Mongoose `SchemaType` options define how each field in your schema behaves and how Mongoose validates it before saving to the database. Common options include:

- `required` to make a field mandatory.
- `unique` to ensure values don‚Äôt repeat across documents.
- `lowercase` to automatically convert strings to lowercase.
- `trim` to remove extra spaces.
- `min` and `max` for numeric ranges.
- `minLength` and `maxLength` for string length constraints.

---

## üìå 2. Add `required`, `unique`, `lowercase`, `min`, `minLength`, `trim`

**Answer:**  
These schema options should be applied to appropriate fields to ensure data is valid and clean:

- Use `required` for fields like `firstName`, `emailId`, and `password` to make them mandatory.
- Use `unique` for `emailId` to prevent duplicate emails.
- Use `lowercase` for `emailId` so it‚Äôs always stored in lowercase.
- Use `trim` for names and about fields to remove unnecessary spaces.
- Use `min` for numeric fields like `age` to ensure valid values.
- Use `minLength` for strings like `password` to enforce minimum length.

---

## üìå 3. Add `default`

**Answer:**  
A `default` value provides fallback data when no value is provided for a field. It ensures the field is never empty and has a sensible default, like a placeholder image for `photoUrl` or a default bio for `about`.

---

## üìå 4. Create a Custom Validate Function for `gender`

**Answer:**  
A custom validator ensures that the `gender` field only accepts specific allowed values, like ‚Äúmale‚Äù, ‚Äúfemale‚Äù, or ‚Äúother‚Äù. This helps maintain consistent data and avoids invalid entries.

---

## üìå 5. Improve the DB Schema ‚Äî Add Appropriate Validations

**Answer:**  
The schema should use all suitable Mongoose validation options and the `validator` library to make sure each field stores only valid and clean data. Validations should cover strings, numbers, formats, and value ranges to avoid bad or incomplete data.

---

## üìå 6. Add `timestamps` to the `userSchema`

**Answer:**  
Enabling `timestamps` in Mongoose automatically adds `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields to each document. This helps track when each record was created and last updated, which is useful for auditing and sorting.

---

## üìå 7. Add API-Level Validation on `PATCH` Requests & `Signup` POST API

**Answer:**  
Validation should also happen at the API layer, not just the database. Using libraries like `express-validator` helps check incoming request data for required fields, correct formats, minimum lengths, and sanitization **before** it even reaches the database.

---

## üìå 8. Data Sanitizing ‚Äî Add API Validation for Each Field

**Answer:**  
Always sanitize user input at the API level to remove unwanted spaces, normalize emails, and escape potentially harmful characters. This prevents invalid or unsafe data from being stored and helps protect against injection attacks.

---

## üìå 9. Install `validator`

**Answer:**  
The `validator` library is a popular Node.js tool for checking and sanitizing strings. It provides built-in functions to validate email addresses, URLs, passwords, and more. It should be installed and used for schema validation and API checks.

---

## üìå 10. Explore `validator` Library Functions and Use Them for `password`, `email`, `photoUrl`

**Answer:**  
Use `validator` functions to:

- Check if `emailId` is in valid email format.
- Validate that `photoUrl` is a proper URL.
- Enforce strong passwords that meet security standards.
  Validator functions reduce the chance of invalid data entering the system.

---

## üìå 11. ‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER TRUST `req.body`

**Answer:**  
Always remember that client input can‚Äôt be trusted by default. Never directly use `req.body` values without validation and sanitization. Always run input through validators and sanitizers to protect the database and your application from bad or malicious data.

# ‚úÖ That‚Äôs it!

Keep these best practices in mind to maintain a clean, secure, and robust database design with Mongoose and Node.js.

# ‚úÖ Auth & Cookies ‚Äî Questions & Answers

---

## üìå 1. Install `cookie-parser`

**Answer:**  
`cookie-parser` is a middleware for Express that makes it easy to read and set cookies in HTTP requests and responses. Install it to handle cookies securely.

---

## üìå 2. Just Send a Dummy Cookie to User

**Answer:**  
To test cookies, send a dummy cookie (like a test key-value pair) in a response. This ensures your cookie setup works before adding JWT tokens.

---

## üìå 3. Create `GET /profile` API and Check if You Get the Cookie Back

**Answer:**  
Create a `/profile` route that reads cookies from incoming requests. This verifies that the cookie was set properly and is returned by the browser or API client.

---

## üìå 4. Install `jsonwebtoken`

**Answer:**  
`jsonwebtoken` (JWT) is a library for creating and verifying JSON Web Tokens. JWTs are used for stateless authentication ‚Äî meaning no session storage is needed on the server.

---

## üìå 5. In `login` API, After Email and Password Validation, Create a JWT Token and Send It in Cookies

**Answer:**  
After successfully checking the user‚Äôs credentials, generate a JWT token containing the user‚Äôs ID or relevant data. Send this token to the user in a secure cookie for use in future authenticated requests.

---

## üìå 6. Read the Cookies Inside Your `profile` API and Find the Logged-In User

**Answer:**  
When a request hits `/profile`, extract the JWT from the cookie, verify it, and get the user‚Äôs ID. Use this ID to fetch and return the user‚Äôs details from the database.

---

## üìå 7. `userAuth` Middleware

**Answer:**  
The `userAuth` middleware reads the JWT from the request cookies, verifies it, and attaches the user‚Äôs information to `req.user`. This makes it easy to protect routes that require authentication.

---

## üìå 8. Add `userAuth` Middleware to `profile` API and `sendConnectionRequest` API

**Answer:**  
Apply the `userAuth` middleware to any API route that needs the user to be logged in. This ensures only authenticated users can access actions like viewing profiles or sending connection requests.

---

## üìå 9. Set the Expiry of JWT Token and Cookies to 7 Days

**Answer:**  
Set the JWT to expire in 7 days for better security and user experience. Also, set the cookie‚Äôs expiry to match the token lifespan so the user stays logged in for the same period.

---

## üìå 10. Create `userSchema` Method to `getJWT()`

**Answer:**  
Add a method to your Mongoose `userSchema` that generates and returns a signed JWT containing the user‚Äôs ID. This keeps token generation reusable and clean.

---

## üìå 11. Create `userSchema` Method to `comparePassword(passwordInputByUser)`

**Answer:**  
Add a method to your Mongoose `userSchema` that checks if the input password matches the hashed password stored in the database. This is used during login to verify the user‚Äôs credentials securely.

---

# ‚úÖ That‚Äôs it!

With these steps, your Node.js app will handle cookies, JWT auth, and secure protected routes using best practices.
